			<h3>Dr. Amy L. Harrington of the University of Massachusetts receives Certified Physician Executive credentialing through American Association for Physician Leadership®</h3>
			<p>Worcester, MA, May 18th, 2018 – The American Association for Physician Leadership® announced Amy Harrington M.D. of the University of Massachusetts Medical School of Worcester, MA has earned the prestigious Certified Physician Executive (CPE) certification. CPE designation indicates a physician has achieved superior levels of professional excellence and management education while also demonstrating effective health care industry knowledge and leadership skills.</p>
			<p>The certification is the industry benchmark for CEOs and executive recruiters seeking the most accomplished and influential physician leaders. It speaks to the physician’s commitment to improving patient care.</p>
			<p>“The contemporary challenges facing health care today — such as variable clinical quality, persistent, high institutional costs in the face of clarifying value, and less than optimal patient experiences — require physician leaders who can interlace clinical knowledge, seasoned leadership skills and superior management acumen,” said Dr. Peter Angood, president and CEO of the American Association for Physician Leadership®.</p>
			<p>he American Association for Physician Leadership® is the nation’s largest organization solely focused on leadership education and management training for physicians. Chartered by the American Association for Physician Leadership® to establish and maintain the high standards required for physician executive certification, the Certifying Commission in Medical Management has a 20-year history as a national, not-for-profit corporation certifying physicians specializing in medical management. The Certifying Commission in Medical Management currently lists more than 3300 Certified Physician Executives.</p>
